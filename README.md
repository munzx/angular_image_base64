# angular_image_base64

A very light weight (500~ Bytes minified) angular directive that helps you get any image's base64 data. it loads the image into the ngModel and sets the element validity as well. It watches the element changes and if a file gets uploaded it set the model validity to valid and to invalid if not.


# Usage

Download the directive or use npm to get it.
`npm install npm i angular_image_base_64`

Include the directive file into your home page, add "ngImageBase64Directive" as a dependency to your angular app, and then add "ng-image-base64" to the form file input element.


- Include the directive
`<script src="/path/to/folder/angular_image_base64.min.js"></script>`

- Add it as a dependency
`angular.module('app', ['ngImageBase64Directive']);`



#Example
`<input type="file" accept="image/*" data-ng-model="data.image" name="image" ng-image-base64 required>`

#Note
Use `accept="image/*"` in your form file input element to restrict the uploading to image files only.
